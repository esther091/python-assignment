Logical Operators include:
1. and (Logical AND)
* Returns True only if both operands are truthy.
* Short-circuits: stops evaluation as soon as it finds a falsy value.
Example;
True and True      # True
True and False     # False
0 and 5            # 0 (falsy)
5 and 0            # 0 (falsy)
5 and 10           # 10 (last truthy value)

2. or (Logical OR)
* Returns True if at least one operand is truthy.
* Short-circuits: stops at the first truthy value.
Example;
False or True      # True
0 or 5             # 5 (first truthy)
5 or 0             # 5 (first truthy)
0 or []            # [] (still falsy)
0 or [] or "hi"    # "hi" (first truthy)

3. not (Logical NOT)
* Returns the opposite boolean value.
* Only works with one operand.
Example;
not True           # False
not False          # True
not 0              # True (0 is falsy)
not "hello"        # False ("hello" is truthy)
